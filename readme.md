# k8s-dashboard

Simple and lightweight Kubernetes dashboard similar to Grafana, Lens, Headlamp, etc. (but with far
fewer features), for my personal use.

Deployed at: [k8s-dashboard.lolei.dev](https://k8s-dashboard.lolei.dev)

## Information

Only a few tools are needed to make this work, on any cluster.  
I talk more about this in a [blog post](https://lolei.dev/posts/2021-08-07-my-own-kubernetes-dashboard.md).
